				<p>The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and 
				in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
				<p>[2] In ancient philosophy, Natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of
				the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals,
				and other features of the world developof their own accord.[3][4]</p>
